Hi there! I'm Jack and I've built this site to showcase projects I'm passionate about. I've been in the IT sector for nearly 15 years, starting as a support desk representative and progressing to my current role as a product engineer.

The reason why I built this site is to:

1. Learn about new technologies
2. Put into practice what I've learned
3. Push myself to see what I can achieve
4. Document what I've learned


{: .note }
Some of the content on this site comes from other sources, which will be referenced at the bottom of each relevant page.

Enjoy :-)
