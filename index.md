Hi there!  

I'm Jack and I'm driven by a strong desire to understand how technology truly functions. I believe in proactively exploring the boundaries of systems, not to cause disruption, but to anticipate potential issues and develop robust solutions. By experimenting in safe environments like sandboxes, I like to analyze cause-and-effect relationships â€“ for instance, how altering a configuration setting impacts application behavior. This hands-on approach allows me to continuously learn and enhance my own technical expertise while preparing me to effectively troubleshoot and resolve complex problems.

The reason why I built this site is to:

1. Learn about new technologies
2. Put into practice what I've learned
3. Push myself to see what I can achieve
4. Document what I've learned

{: .note }
Some of the content on this site comes from other sources, which will be referenced at the bottom of each relevant page.  

Enjoy :-)
