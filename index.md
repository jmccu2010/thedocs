Hi there, I’m Jack and I’ve built this site to be a placeholder where I can show off projects that I’m interested in. I’ve been in the IT sector for nearly 15 years. I started off as a support desk representative, and now I’m a product engineer..

My current job role requires me to test and develop solutions to problems, once a solution has been found, it’s deployed to production using GitHub or Microsoft Intune. During testing and development, I get to break technology to understand cause and effect. I find this exciting.

The reason why I built this site is to continue to:

1. Learn about new technology’s.
2. Put into practice what I’ve learned.
3. Push myself to see what I can achieve.
