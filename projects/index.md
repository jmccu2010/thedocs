## About this Project

### Hardware

ThinkCentre M715 Tiny (2nd Gen)  
AMD Ryzen 3 PRO 2200GE with Radeon Vega Graphics  
16GB of RAM  
500 GB SSD drive - This wil be replaced with a 2TB SSD drive
500 GB M.2 drive - This will host the LXC Containers

### Operating System

Proxmox Virtual Environment Server

### What do I want to build?

I plan to :

1. Redeploy Proxmox OS  
Although I've already installed Proxmox on the 500 GB M.2 drive, I plan to upgrade internal storage from a 500 GB SSD to a 2TB SSD drive, I'll perform a clean install of Proxmox OS on the 500 GB M.2 drive.

1. Deploy two LXC Containers
   1. Jellyfin with Cockpit Web Console  
       - This will be my personal media and data drive server. 


   2. Docker Server
2. Deploy Linux Mint
