## Setting up 'theDocs Portal'
theDocs Portal template has been taken from [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs?tab=readme-ov-file#installation/) Github Website.[^1]  

## Reason for using this template
When doing my research into self hosting webpage content, I first came across MKDocs template [^2], the layout, functionally, customizability and useability was straight forward, I landed on Just the Docs template because it required a more learning curve. 

## Skills that I'm learning
1. Markdown Language
2. Building site locally
3. Deploying site to GitHub Pages
4. Editing website via Github Codespace
