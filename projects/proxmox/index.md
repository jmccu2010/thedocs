## About this Project



### What do I want to build?


I plan to :

1. Redeploy Proxmox OS  
2. Deploy LXC Containers
   1. Jellyfin with Cockpit Web Console  
   2. Docker Server

3. Deploy Windows 11 Virtual Machine



The goal is to have a mini server were I can access my media content locally within my network and from within each of the Containers or VMs.
